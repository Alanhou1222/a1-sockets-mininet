2)    Predicted throughput: 20Mbps
      Predicted latency: 120ms
      Actual throughput: 19.450Mbps
      Actual latency: 121.375ms
      Explanation of results: throughput is the minimum of all links and latency is the sum of all links.

3.1)  Predicted throughput: 10Mbps, 10Mbps
      Predicted latency: 120ms, 120ms
      Actual throughput: 10.525Mbps 10.435Mbps
      Actual latency: 121.051ms, 121.107s
      Explanation of results: throughput should be 1/2 because two pairs are communicating and lantency shouldn't change because all are on the same links path and requires no switching

3.2)  Predicted throughput: 6.667Mbps, 6.667Mbps, 6.667Mbps
      Predicted latency: 120ms, 120ms, 120ms
      Actual throughput: 7.320Mbps, 7.290Mbps, 7.301Mbps
      Actual latency: 120.709ms, 120.728ms, 120.694ms
      Explanation of results: throughput should be 1/3 because three pairs are communicating and lantency shouldn't change because all are on the same links path and requires no switching

4)    Predicted throughput: 12.5Mbps
      Predicted latency:
      Actual throughput:
      Actual latency:
      Explanation of results:
